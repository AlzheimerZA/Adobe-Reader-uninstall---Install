# Adobe-Reader-uninstall---Install
The script can be used to uninstall old versions of Adobe Reader and install the new specified version

**Update the script to your requirements:**

LINE 66 you specify a version that should not be uninstalled if found

LINE 95 can be used to download the EXE directly from Adobe (This needs to be updated should once newer versions become available)

LINE 98 can be used to get the file from a fileshare instead of downloading the file
